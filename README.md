But before testing it you have to set it upp first :)

step 1) Setup the node.js server

            1) Open "Backend" folder with VsCode
            2) Open Terminal and make sure the directory is on "Backend" folder
            3) Type "npm install" then press Enter, wait for Node_moduels to finish
            4) Type "npm run start" then you should get a message "Server is up and running!"
            5) Server is now running on port 3000

Step 2) Setup react

            1) Open "Frontend" folder with VsCode
            2) Open Terminal and make sure the directory is in "Frontend" folder
            3) Type "npm install" then press Enter, wait for Node_moduels to finish
            4) Type "npm run start" then you should get a message that port 3000 is already in use (by node.js) and if you would like to change the port to 3001...
            5) Type "Y" then press Enter
            6) React should now be upp at http://localhost:3001/

Now you can start testing the application :)
